# Arduino Firmware

In order to evaluate the possibilities of prosthetic hand we write a simple firmware for arduino using this [library](http://robottini.altervista.
org/dongbu-herkulex-arduino-library-2) for Herkulex DRS-0201. We modified the library in order to control the motor with arduino micro pro.


# Next Steps

The next steps is to control the prosthetic hands with different interfaces like [these](https://github.com/OpenBionics/Robot-Hands/tree/master/CAD/Interfaces) or like EMG sensor.
