# Î‘ Body Powered Actuation System for Prosthetic Hands

## The Idea

An old and reliable method of controlling prosthetic devices is by using a harness-socket actuation system in a body powered manner. In order to further reduce the cost of our prosthetic hands omitting any kind of electronics and servos, we designed a body powered actuation system that an amputee can use as an interface to control a prosthetic hand. The proposed system is inspired by the classic harness-socket actuation systems but is designed as an exosceleton.

## Description

The proposed body powered actuation systems, consists of 
* modular 3D-printed parts 
* pins, dowels or shafts
* velcro tape
* an elastic arm sleeve
* dyneema thread

The mechanism can be replicated and assembled quite easily as depicted in the picture below. The cost of the system is less than 25$. Enjoy!
